1: What are the three longest trips on rainy days? 

SELECT 
    t.zip_code, 
    t.duration, 
    DATE(t.start_date) date_trip
FROM
    trips t
JOIN
    weather w
ON
    date_trip=w.Date and
	t.zip_code=w.ZIP
WHERE 
		w.PrecipitationIn != 0
GROUP BY 1, 3
ORDER BY 2 desc
limit 3

2: Which station is empty most often?

SELECT 
	station_id,
	COUNT(*)
FROM 
	status
WHERE 
	bikes_available = 0
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 2 DESC

Would this work also?

SELECT 
	station_id,
	(CASE WHEN bikes_available = 0 THEN 'Empty' END), 
	COUNT(*) as times_empty
FROM 
	status
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 2 DESC


3: Return a list of stations with a count of number of trips start at that station but ordered by dock count.

with 
	starting 
as (
	select
		name,
		dockcount
	from
		stations
	order by 2
)

select
	start_station,
	count(*),
	st.dockcount
from
	trips t
join
	starting st
on 
	t.start_station = st.name
group by 1
order by 3

4: 

-- These are the days where it rained. 
SELECT 
	weather.Date,
	weather.ZIP,
	weather.PrecipitationIn
FROM 
	weather
WHERE 
	weather.PrecipitationIn != 0
GROUP BY 1

--- Here is where I get the trip dates and durations. 
SELECT 
	trip_id,
	start_date,
	duration
FROM 
	trips
GROUP BY
