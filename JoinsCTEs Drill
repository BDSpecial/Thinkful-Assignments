1: What are the three longest trips on rainy days? This is the best that I can do but I know that it is not correct because when
I try to check my answers on with the dataset it is not correct. 

 WITH rain_stations AS (
	SELECT 
		weather.Date,
		weather.ZIP,
		weather.PrecipitationIn
	FROM 
		weather
	WHERE 
		weather.PrecipitationIn != 0
	GROUP BY 1
)

SELECT 
	trips.trip_id,
	trips.duration,
	trips.start_date,
	trips.zip_code
FROM 
	trips
JOIN 
	rain_stations
ON 
	trips.start_date = rain_stations.Date
ORDER BY 2 DESC

2: Which station is empty most often?

SELECT 
	station_id,
COUNT(*)
FROM 
	status
WHERE 
	bikes_available = 0
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 2 DESC

Would this work also?

SELECT 
	station_id,
	(CASE WHEN bikes_available = 0 THEN 'Empty' END), 
	COUNT(*) as times_empty
FROM 
	status
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 2 DESC


3: Return a list of stations with a count of number of trips start at that station but ordered by dock count.

-- This allows me to get the station information for id, name, and dockcount and order it according to it's dockcount
select
	station_id,
	name,
	dockcount
from
	stations
order by 3

-- This allows me to count up the number of times a trip starts at a location
select
	start_station,
	COUNT(*)
from
	trips
group by 1

-- Why doesn't this work to allow me to join the previous two queries? 
WITH 
	starting
AS (
		select
			start_station,
			COUNT(*)
		from
			trips
		group by 1
)

select
	station_id,
	name,
	dockcount
from
	stations
join
	starting
on 
	stations.name = starting.start_station
order by 3


4: 

-- These are the days where it rained. 
SELECT 
	weather.Date,
	weather.ZIP,
	weather.PrecipitationIn
FROM 
	weather
WHERE 
	weather.PrecipitationIn != 0
GROUP BY 1

--- Here is where I get the trip dates and durations. 
SELECT 
	trip_id,
	start_date,
	duration
FROM 
	trips
GROUP BY
