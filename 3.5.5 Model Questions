You now have a fairly substantial starting toolbox of supervised learning methods that you can use to tackle a host of exciting
problems. To make sure all of these ideas are organized in your mind, please go through the list of problems below. For each, 
identify which supervised learning method(s) would be best for addressing that particular problem. Explain your reasoning and 
discuss your answers with your mentor.

1. Predict the running times of prospective Olympic sprinters using data from the last 20 Olympics.
  - I believe that a linear regression model would work well for predicting the running times. A multivariable linear 
    regression is well suited to taking multiple variables and seeing how they impact our outcome of intest, running times. A 
    model could quickly create a model where: running time = alpha + age + height + weight + years_running + fastest_time + 
    ethnicity + nationality + etc. I think that this would be a quick and reliable model that could also produce several 
    interesting insights into the what characteristics have the greatest impact on the running time. 
2. You have more features (columns) than rows in your dataset.
  - If I am working with a dataset where I have more features than rows, I would likely try to reduce the model to the 
    features that are most important to the desired outcome. A Lasso model would work very well in my opinion because it can 
    elimiate uninformative variables by setting their coefficents to zero. This ability to eliminate some of the features will 
    likely strengthen my model's speed and predictive ability. 
3. Identify the most important characteristic predicting likelihood of being jailed before age 20.
  - In this sceniero I am needing a model that tells me which characteristics are most important for the likelihood of being 
    jailed before age 20
    logistic regression, decision tree but not a random forest
4. Implement a filter to “highlight” emails that might be important to the recipient
  - random forest, naive baise, SVM
5. You have 1000+ features.
  - Ridge or Lasso
6. Predict whether someone who adds items to their cart on a website will purchase the items.
  - random forest, naive baise, SVM
7. Your dataset dimensions are 982400 x 500
  - Ridge and Lasso
8. Identify faces in an image.
  - SVM, Lasso
9. Predict which of three flavors of ice cream will be most popular with boys vs girls.
  - naive baise
