For each of these scenarios decide if you could use supervised or unsupervised techniques, or both!

1. Define the likelihood that an individual will contract a specific disease.
  - Supervised, because I have an outcome variable that I'm interested in predicting. 
2. Translate a set of images into variables for modeling
  - Unsupervised, because I don't have a problem or outcome that I want to predict but rather a set of images that I want to
    make into independent variables. 
3. An ecommerce company wants to identify power users
  - Supervised, because I have an outcome variable that I'm interested in predicting.
4. That same company wants to see shopping patterns in users
  - Unsupervised, because I don't have a problem or outcome that I want to predict but rather a dataset that they want to find
    out the patters of users. 
5. You want to reduce the number of variables inputting into your random forest model
  - Unsupervised, because I want to find the variable importance rather than predicting any outcome.
