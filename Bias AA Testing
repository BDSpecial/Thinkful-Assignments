For each of the following scenarios, call out the potential biases in the proposed experiment. Do your best to try to discover
not only the bias, but the initial design.

1: You're testing advertising emails for a bathing suit company and you test one version of the email in February and the        other in May.
  - The obvious bias that I see right away in this example is sending the two emails out three months apart. There are
    differences in the weather and day light hours between February and May that could easily impact the response rate to 
    advertisments. This is a contextual bias. 
2: You open a clinic to treat anxiety and find that the people who visit show a higher rate of anxiety than the general          population.
  - This is a sampling bias because naturally a clinic centered around a specific problem will select out the people in the 
    population who share this condition. For example a cancer clinic will likely only be visited by individuals with cancer,
    not the cancer free people who are found in the generalized population. 
3: You launch a new ad billboard based campaign and see an increase in website visits in the first week.
  - Without more details about the new billboard, I would say that this could be a contextual bias because maybe there are 
    other location or time of year factors that are actually impacting the number of website visits. 
4: You launch a loyalty program but see no change in visits in the first week.
  - So far, the bias that I see in this study is the assignment to the condition procedure. Is a loyalty program suppose to 
    change the number of visits or impact the retention rate? What is the key metric with which I am comparing the loyalty 
    program with the changes in visits?
