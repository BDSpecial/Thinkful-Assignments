Let's say we work at a credit card company and we're trying to figure out if people are going to pay their bills on time. We 
have everyone's purchases, split into four main categories: groceries, dining out, utilities, and entertainment. What are some 
ways you might use KNN to create this model? What aspects of KNN would be useful? Write up your thoughts in submit a link 
below.

In this example each of the categories are measured in the same units, dollars or some other currancy. Normalzie my data by rescaling
by subtracting mean and standard deviation divide. However, this scenario would benefit from a K-Nearest Neighbors by 
seeing how the groceries, dining out, and entertainment predicted the payment of utilities but rather total credit card bill. 
We can run different models with 
different combinations of these features to see how well they can predict the outcome correctly. A beneficial part of KNN would 
be the ability to weigh the observations used in K by the distance or how densely the dataset is populated.
