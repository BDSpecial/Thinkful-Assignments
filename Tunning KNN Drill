Let's say we work at a credit card company and we're trying to figure out if people are going to pay their bills on time. We 
have everyone's purchases, split into four main categories: groceries, dining out, utilities, and entertainment. What are some 
ways you might use KNN to create this model? What aspects of KNN would be useful?

This scenario would benefit from a K-Nearest Neighbors by seeing how the groceries, dining out, entertainment, and utilities
can together predict the payment of the total credit card bill every month. Aother beneficial part of KNN would be the ability 
to choose the number of neighbors to use as the K and being able to weigh the observations used in K by the distance to the 
predicted datapoint. I also see the benefit of a KNN with choosing only a few of the features, say dining out and entertainment,
as the features to fit the model for total credit card payment every month. As a side note, in this example each of the 
categories are measured in the same units, dollars or some other currancy. However, in order to use a KNN model in this example
I will need to normalize each of my variables by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation for each feature.
