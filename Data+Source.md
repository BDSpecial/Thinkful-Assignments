In each of the scenarios, find possible shortcomings of the data sources to answer the given question. What could be done to either adjust the analysis or reframe the question so that you can answer it accurately?

- Data Source: Amsterdam availability data scraped from AirBnB on December 24th. Question: What are the popular neighborhoods in Amsterdam?
I think that the main issues with this data is its Exceptional Circumstance and bias. The availability of AirBnBs is not necessarily going to tell you the popularity of neighborhoods. So I think that it will be important to limit your conclusion to popularity of AirBnBs is various neighborhoods rather than the popularity of neighborhoods as a whole. The availability of AirBnBs is also going to be drastically different on December 24th compared to the rest of the year. But maybe this is the time of year that you want to focus on. If that is the case, then make sure to explisitly covey this information. If you are wanting to compare this data to trends for the rest of the year, then try to use data that shows the yearly availability of AirBnBs so that you can compare your data to it. But regardless, don't try to generalize your data to the rest of the year in Amsterdam. The question could be: What are the popular AirBnB neighborhoods in Amsterdam around Christmas?
- Data Source: Mental health services use on September 12, 2001 in San Francisco, CA and New York City, NY. Question: How do patterns of mental health service use vary between cities?
This data source is both biased and subject to an exceptional circumstance. The bias is from the data only including two major cities and being limited to one day. This bias severely limits your data's applicability to other cities or being able to capture trends across time. So unless you can expand geography or scope of the data then your conclusions will only be narrowly applicable. The exceptional circumstance is from the data being collected the day after the September 11th attack on the World Trade Center. The rate of mental health services would likely be drastically different after the terrorist attack than before it. So if you are wanting to adjust for this event then maybe compare your data to trends that are months before and after this event. The question could be: How did the rate of mental health services change after September 11, 2001 in San Fracisco and New York City?
- Data Source: Armenian Pub Survey. Question: What are the most common reasons Armenians visit local pubs?
This data is affected by a bias and quality problem. The bias is that it is data from only one Armenian survey rather than multiple surveys. The quality problem, is how many Armenians actually took this survey. Did this survey come from only one line of pubs? What kind of Armenian was likely to be offered this survey? You can try to adjust for this bias by searching out additional Armenia pub surveys and comparing your data to theirs. But if you can't find out additional data then limiting the scope of the conclusions to only the reasons given by Armenians in this survey. So the question could be: What were the most common reasons that a sample of Armenians gave for visiting local pubs in an Armenian Pub Survey.
