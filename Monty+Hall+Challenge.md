You are on a game show and given the choice of whatever is behind three doors. Behind one door is a fantastic prize (some examples use a car, others use cash) while behind the other two doors is a dud (some examples say a goat, others say it's just empty). You pick a door. Then the host opens one of the other two doors to reveal a dud. But here's the wrinkle: the host now gives you the opportunity to switch your door. What should you do?

My initial thought is that I would keep my same door choice. 

- P(Prize) = 1/3 or 0.3333
- P(Dud) = 2/3 or 0.6666
- P(Prize|Two_doors) = 1/2 or 0.5


Bayes' rule says:
----------------
P(Prize|Switching) =
_____________________
P(Prize) * P(Prize|Two_doors) /
________________________________
P(Dud)

= 0.3333 * 0.5 / 0.6666 = 0.16665 / 0.6666 = 0.25 or 25% chance of prize behind door if switching.

Since the inital chance of the Prize being behind the first choosen door is 33.33%, I would stay with my inital selection rather than changing to the door with a lower chance of 25%.
