1: What's the most expensive listing? What else can you tell me about the listing?

- There are three listings that are equally 'most' expensive. Each of these have a price of $10,000. Two of these listings
market themselves as close to Downtown Austin. One of them says that a personal chef and driver is available. Of these three,
the most recent host has been hosting since March, 2016 and the longest host started in October, 2014. One host says that they
have designed their location to be like a cathedral, a place of, "refuge, beauty, and joy."

WITH maximum AS (
	SELECT 
		MAX(CAST(SUBSTR(REPLACE(price, ',', ''),2)AS DECIMAL)) AS max_price
	FROM 
		listings
)

SELECT 
	*
FROM 
	listings,
	maximum
WHERE 
	(CAST(SUBSTR(REPLACE(price, ',', ''),2)AS DECIMAL)) = maximum.max_price
	
2: What neighborhoods seem to be the most popular?

WITH empty AS (
	SELECT 
		listing_id,
		count(CASE WHEN available = 'f' THEN 1 END)*1.0 / count(available) AS rate_available
	FROM 
		calendar
	GROUP BY listing_id
)

SELECT 
	AVG(rate_available) AS rate_available,
	listings.neighbourhood_cleansed AS zip_code
FROM 
	empty
JOIN 
	listings
ON
	empty.listing_id = listings.id
GROUP BY
	neighbourhood_cleansed
ORDER BY rate_available DESC


3: What time of year is the cheapest time to go to your city? What about the busiest?

-- It appears that March is the cheapest time of year in Austin. 
SELECT 
	date,
	AVG(CAST(SUBSTR(REPLACE(price, ',', ''),2)AS DECIMAL)) AS average_price
FROM 
	calendar
GROUP BY date
ORDER BY average_price

-- It appears that March is also the time of year with the highest unavailability. 
SELECT 
	date,
	available,
	count(*) AS not_available
FROM 
	calendar
WHERE 
	available = 'f'
GROUP BY date
ORDER BY not_available DESC
