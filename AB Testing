1: Does a new supplement help people sleep better?
  - Two Versions:
    Ideally I would like to see group A be people who start taking the supplement, group B are people who are taking a
    placebo, and if possible group C would be people who are not taking anything at all. 
  - A Sample:
    I would like my sample to come from a population who reports problems with sleep deprivation. Maybe this is a sample from
    a doctor's office or users of a sleep monitoring app. Regardless of where the sample comes from, I would try to evenly 
    spread out the other known attributes of the sample group between the two or three versions of the test. 
  - A Hypothesis:
    My hypothesis would be, "I expect people who take the supplement to report or record better sleep quality." 
  - Outcomes of Interest:
    Since I would ideally want my key metric to be passively measured, it would be best if my sample group is already using a
    sleep monitoring device and the different patterns of the sample's sleep behavior would be controlled for. My key metric
    would be duration.
  - Other measured variables:
    To get a better picture of whether the supplement improves overall sleep, I would also be measuring how quickly the
    samples fall asleep, the depth of sleep attained, and the overall reported quality of sleep between the groups.
2: Will new uniforms help a gym's business?
  - Two Versions:
    I would like to have group A be a sample six week time period that wears the uniforms and group B the time period that 
    wears casual clothing. 
  - A Sample:
    Since this study is located at only one gym I would try to impliment and measure these two versions at roughly the same 
    time of year or spread out one year apart but during equally routine, calm time periods. I would not carry out this study 
    during the holidays, new years, or other gym specials. I would try and control for seasonal changes and other factors that
    lead to increased gym rates from specific demographics. For example, the beginning of summer might lead to increased 
    student members compared to other times of year. 
  - A Hypothesis:
    That professional, consistent employee uniforms will improve a gym's growth and recruitment. 
  - Outcomes of Interest:
    In order to isolate the uniform variable, I would try and monitor over time, seasons, and business model the change in
    business growth between the gym's two six week periods. The key metric of this test is the gym's growth in members not it's
    ratings or reviews. 
  - Other measured variables:
    However, I might also monitor changes in the gym's ratings, reviews, and employee retainment. 
3: Will a new homepage improve my online exotic pet rental business?
  - Two Versions:
    Group A would be a random sample of online users who are sent to the old online homepage and Group B would be the random 
    sample that is sent to the new homepage. 
  - A Sample:
    My samples would ideally be online users with different backgrounds and using the website homepages at different times of 
    day. If I cannot post both version of the homepage at the same time, then I would try to have both version up online at 
    equivalent times of day and year. 
  - A Hypothesis:
    My hypothesis would be, "the new homepage increases the number of rentals for my exotic pet company." 
  - Outcomes of Interest:
    My key metric would be the number of rentals from users who contacted the business through the new or old homepage. If I 
    cannot know who exactly is contacting the business through each website, I can compare the rates if I have equally used 
    the homepages at equivalent time of day and year. 
  - Other measured variables:
    I could also measure the amount of time that users spend on each homepage and the number of emails or questions received. 
4: If I put 'please read' in the email subject will more people read my emails?
  - Two Versions:
    Version A would be the emails with 'please read' in the subject title and version B is those without it. 
  - A Sample:
    If I am emailing the same consistent group of people, I would try to evenly divide the known attributes of this group into
    each sample. I would also send out the two version of emails at the same time of day to try and control for differences in 
    email response rates during the times of day. 
  - A Hypothesis:
    My hypothesis is, "the 'please read' in the subject title will increase the rate of people who read my emails." 
  - Outcomes of Interest:
    My metric of interest is the number of people who open my emails rather than deleting them before it is opened or read. 
  - Other measured variables:
    I could also measure the number of responses to my emails on top of any changes to the deleting rate.
