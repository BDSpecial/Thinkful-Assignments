1: Does a new supplement help people sleep better?
  - Two Versions:
    Ideally I would like to see group A be people who start taking the supplement, group B are people who are taking a
    placebo, and if possible group C would be people who are not taking anything at all. 
  - A Sample:
    I would like my sample to come from a population who reports problems with sleep deprivation. Maybe this is a sample from
    a doctor's office or users of a sleep monitoring app. Regardless of where the sample comes from, I would try to evenly 
    spread out the other known attributes of the sample group between the two or three versions of the test. 
  - A Hypothesis:
    My hypothesis would be, "I expect people who take the supplement to report or record better sleep quality." 
  - Outcomes of Interest:
    Since I would ideally want my key metric to be passively measured, it would be best if my sample group is already using a
    sleep monitoring device and the different patterns of the sample's sleep behavior would be controlled for. My key metric
    would be duration.
  - Other measured variables:
    To get a better picture of whether the supplement improves overall sleep, I would also be measuring how quickly the
    samples fall asleep, the depth of sleep attained, and the overall reported quality of sleep between the groups.
2: Will new uniforms help a gym's business?
  - Two Versions:
    I would like to have group A be a sample that wears the uniforms and group B the sample that wears casual clothing. 
  - A Sample:
    It would be hard to make a sample out of only one gym's employees because controlling for the environment of the gym while 
    somehow measuring that half of their uniformed employee improved their business would be very diffcult to show. So I 
    would like to make a sample out of two partnered or nearby gyms. I can try to control for the different environments and
    locations of these gyms. Hopefully these gyms serve the same population base and provide similar services to gym members.
