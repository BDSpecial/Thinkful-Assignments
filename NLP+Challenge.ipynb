    "This was a difficult challenge for me due to my computer's issues with processing the data and this being my first deep dive into Natural Language Processing. I can see that a number of decisions during each step of my data processing affected my model's accuracy. For example, when I started to clean up the text, my text cleaning function removed all forms of punctuation. I have seen how this limited the BoW and TF_IDF methods' ability to separate contractions into their own words. \n",
    "\n",
    "Then it came time to use models with these methods to predict the rating of the statements. None of my models did significantly better than the others. The accuracy always seemed to stay around 70% for both methods and three different types of models. Now, when I tried to increase my score by 5 points I decided to use the Logistic Regression Classifier because it didn't overfit as much as the random forest, it ran faster that the Gradient Boosting Classifier, and its accuracy was consistent for both methods. I tried to increase the score by first adjusting the vectorizer parameters and changing the max or minimum document frequency but it showed no improvement to the accuracy. Next, I adjusted the SVD reducer so that it did not decrease the number of features so sharply. This lead to the only noticeable improvement in my accuracy because it went up to 0.73. The last change I did was to make the Logistic Regression model a Lasso model, however this did not make any change in my model's behavior or accuracy. "
