For each of the following situations, decide if you would model using a regression or classification model. 

1. The amount a person will spend on a given site in the next 24 months.
  - Regression model: because it is a continuous variable outcome that is looking for relationship between variables
2. What color car someone is going to buy.
  - Classification model: because car colors are categorical and I want to predict each color or the probability of each color.
3. How many children a family will have.
  - Regression model: because the number of children can be used as a continuous variable and I would like to predict the 
    likelihood of a family having each successive child. 
4. If someone will sign up for a service.
  - Classification model: because signing up is a simple yes or no category and I want to model which variables change my 
    outcome.
5. The number of times someone will get sick in a year.
  - Regression model: because rather than classifying each time sick as a separate discrete event I would be finding my outcome
    and its place on the continuous line. 
6. The probability someone will get sick in the next month.
  - Classification model: because I am classifying the sick event as a yes or no categorical event that I want to find the 
    probability of it happening. 
7. Which medicine will work best for a given patient.
  - Regression model: because I think that medicine and drugs are more than a yes or no categorical outcome. So I am thinking
    of approaching this by predicting the probability that each drug will help improve a patient's condition.
