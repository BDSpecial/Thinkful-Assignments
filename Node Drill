1. Calculate the degree of each node:
    - Mom: 1 You: 5 Aunt Alice: 2 Fiancee: 4 Dave: 3 Brian: 3 
2. Write a list of edges 
    - {Mom, You} 
    - {You, Mom} 
    - {You, Aunt Alice} 
    - {You, Fiancee} 
    - {You, Dave} 
    - {You, Brian} 
    - {Fiancee, Aunt Alice}
    - {Fiancee, You}
    - {Fiancee, Dave} 
    - {Fiancee, Brian}
    - {Dave, Fiancee}
    - {Dave, Brian}
    - {Dave, You}
    - {Brian, Fiancee}
    - {Brian, Dave}
    - {Brian, You}
3. Calculate the clustering coefficient for each node: 
    - You: 8/20 Mom: NA (only links to one node) Aunt Alice: 1 Fiancee: 8/12 Dave: 1 Brian: 1 
4. Calculate the shortest paths between each pair of nodes: 
    - You,Fiancee: 1 
    - You, Mom: 1 
    - You, Aunt Alice: 1 
    - You, Dave: 1 
    - You, Brian: 1 
    - Fiancee, Aunt Alice: 1 
    - Fiancee, Mom: 2 (Fiancee, You, Mom) 
    - Fiancee, Dave: 1 
    - Fiancee, Brian: 1 
    - Aunt Alice, Mom: 2 (Aunt Alice, You, Mom) 
    - Aunt Alice, Dave: 2 (Aunt Alice, You, Dave) (Aunt Alice, Fiancee, Dave) 
    - Aunt Alice, Brian: 2 (Aunt Alice, You, Brian) (Aunt Alice, Fiancee, Brian) 
    - Mom, Dave: 2 (Mom, You, Dave) 
    - Mom, Brian: 2 (Mom, You, Brian) 
    - Dave, Brian: 1 
5. Calculate the betweenness centrality of each node: You: 6/12 Fiancee: 2/12 Mom: 0/12 Aunt Alice: 0/10 Dave: 0/11 Brian: 0/11 
6. Find a walk of length 5 linking Fiancee to You:
    - {Fiancee, Dave, Brian, Dave, You} or 
    - {Fiancee, You, Aunt Alice, Fiancee, You} 
    - {Fiancee, Brian, Dave, Brian, You} 
    - {Fiancee, Brian, You, Aunt Alice, You} etc 
7. Find the shortest path linking Dave to Mom. {Dave, You, Mom} 
8. How long is a cycle linking You to Aunt Alice? 3 {You, Fiancee, Aunt Alice, You}
